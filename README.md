## 🌐 CCNA Enterprise – Overview

The **CCNA Enterprise** course introduces the core concepts of networking, focusing on how devices like routers, switches, and modems communicate over a network.

This certification-level course covers:

- Basics of networking and network devices
- The OSI Model and how data moves between layers
- Understanding IP addressing, subnetting, and routing
- How communication happens between different systems
- Real-world examples and analogies to make networking easy to understand

I'm currently attending classes **three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri – 7:30 to 8:30 AM)** and actively building notes, interview prep material, and project-based learning around it.
